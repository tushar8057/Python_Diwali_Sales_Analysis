## Dataset

The dataset used for this analysis includes various features such as:

- Product ID
- Product Category
- Customer Age
- Gender
- Marital Status
- State
- Amount
- Date of Purchase

## Tools and Libraries

- **Python**: Core programming language used for analysis
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis
- **NumPy**: Numerical operations
- **Matplotlib**: Data visualization
- **Seaborn**: Statistical data visualization

## Project Structure

- **Diwali Sales Data.csv**: The dataset used for the analysis.
- **Diwali_Sales_Analysis.ipynb**: Jupyter Notebook containing the entire analysis process, from data loading and cleaning to visualization and insights.

## Project Description :-
<ul>
<li>Performed Data Cleaning and Data Manipulation.
<li>Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn Libraries.
<li>Improved Customer experience by identifying potential customers across different states, occupation, gender and age groups.
<li>Improved sales by identifying most selling product categories and products, which can help to plan inventory and hence meet the demands.
</ul>

## Analysis and Insights

1. **Sales Distribution**:
   - Analysis of sales distribution across different states and product categories.
   - Identification of top-performing products and states with the highest sales.

2. **Customer Demographics**:
   - Examination of customer demographics such as age, gender, and marital status.
   - Insights into which demographic groups are the highest spenders during Diwali.

3. **Purchase Patterns**:
   - Exploration of purchase patterns over time, identifying peak sales periods.
   - Analysis of average transaction amounts and frequency of purchases.

4. **Product Performance**:
   - Evaluation of product performance based on sales data.
   - Identification of best-selling product categories and products with low sales.

## Key Findings

- Certain states and product categories significantly outperform others in terms of sales.
- Specific demographic groups, particularly married individuals and certain age brackets, tend to spend more during the Diwali season.
- Sales peak during specific periods, indicating effective promotional strategies or heightened consumer interest.
- Top-performing products are consistently in high demand, while some categories may require targeted marketing efforts to boost sales.

## Conclusion :-
<ul>
<li>Married women age group 26-35 yrs from UP, 
<li>Maharastra and Karnataka working in IT, 
<li>Healthcare and Aviation are more likely to buy products from Food, 
<li>Clothing and Electronics category
</ul>
